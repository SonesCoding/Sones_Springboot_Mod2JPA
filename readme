- Near the end of me working on this project, I figure something is wrong with my pom.xml. This certainly isn't a running project anymore.

I fidgeted with JPA which was honestly, probably a mistake on my part. I messed with the joincolumns and figuring out how to make them relational,
but found more success with this tutorial and the help of it.

I learned a lot about what I need to do to flesh out a full database. I added a couple of pages but all the JPA data is displayed in the terminal.

There are some major differences in JPA and JDBC.
